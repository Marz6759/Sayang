      Done laughing at my retarded singing? xD
      <br>
      Sorry not sorry!!
      <br>
      HAHAHHA
      <br>
      Anyways,I'm so sorry I lost the one thing I was working so hard on :(
      <br>
      Please forgive me Sayang...
      <br>
      Enough chit-chat, let's get down to business (to defeat the huns) to what the
      <br>
      hell has happened for the past one year.
      <br>
      To keep it short; within you I found Hazal and our garden.
      <br>
      Within you, I found purpose.
      <br>
      Sayang, for once, I cannot find words to describe what I am feeling.
      <br>
      For once, I feel that the world isn't such a bad place after all.
      <br>
      Truth to be told, I was tempted to write a poem or a story here to express my feelings.
      <br>
      But I find myself getting angry at the fact that I can find nothing to describe this emotional ecstacy
      <br>
      you and I have been through for the past one year.
      <br>
      Instead, I think I shall leave you a single sentence as a way to end this endless train of beautiful thoughts regarding our year;
      <br>
      Forget me not, love me lot, for red roses never rot.

      <br>
      Thank you for the incredible year baby. Let's have a hundred more of these with Hazal in our little garden.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        <strong>Your Jaan.</strong></p>
