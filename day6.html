        Dear Sappy,
      </span>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align:left;
      font-size:20px;width:60%;margin-left:20%">
      We went to Genting Highlands today. I love her. I realized that today.
      <br>
      I really do. Watching her laugh and be happy, I realized that I need her in  my life.
      <br>
      I want to be the one of the reasons why she laughs and gets all red with excitement.
      <br>
      I thought it was just a <em>crush</em>. I really did.
      <br>
      I was <em>wrong</em>.
      <br>
      <strong>I love her.</strong>
      <br>
      I want her.
      <br>
      I whispered all that to her during the rides. When we were falling from
      the top. Well, she was, I was only falling in love with her with every second.
      God please let me tell her. Let there be a a miracle. Let me live my life the
      way I want it. At least this one time.
      <br>
      <br>
      Update: There she was on my bed. I was asked who I liked. I said a girl who wears blue.
      <br>
      I swear I heard the words "I like you". And so we found love like morning dew.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        <strong>Hers.</strong></p>
