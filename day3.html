        Dear Sappy,
      </span>
      <br>

      Penang is so <strong>beautiful</strong>! I usually <em>hate</em> travelling but everything
      felt so pretty and all this time around. Zuhair and his new-found
      buddies (the younger siblings of the girl) were in one car
      while the girl and I were in the other. I'm tired of referring to her as
      just "girl". She has a name. Maybe I'll ask- nevermind, she's sleeping...
      WHO <strong>SLEEPS</strong> ON A TRIP LIKE THIS?! WHY AM I MAD THAT SHE'S SLEEPING?! WHY WOULD I CARE?!
      <br>
      <br>
      Update: We went to the Penang Hills and had loads of fun, she seems like the motherly kind,
      the way she handles her siblings I mean. Wait why did I just think that? Anywayssss~~~~
      she told me that she had a virus on her phone which I had to fix. Oh and I got her name.
      It's <em>Srobona</em>. I wonder what it means. Not gonna lie, the name sounds pretty...
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        <strong>The fixer-upper.</strong></p>
