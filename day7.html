        Dear Sappy,
      </span>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align:left;
      font-size:20px;width:60%;margin-left:20%">
      I spent the whole day playing cards with her. Did I
      ever tell you how <strong>beautiful</strong> her eyes are? No? Now you know...
      She's just so amazing. Why does she have to go?! WHY CANT SHE
      JUST STAY WITH ME <strong>FOREVER</strong>?!
      I KNOW! I NEED TO ASK HER FOR HER NUMBER! THINK MARZOUQ! THINK!
      WHAT'S AN <em>ORIGINAL</em> WAY TO ASK FOR IT?!
      <br>
      Update: WOOOOO I'VE GOT HER NUMBER! OPENED UP A NOTEPAD IN MY PHONE
      AND TITLED IT AS "Number?" THEN PASSED IT TO HER. I WAS HALF AFRAID
      THAT SHE WOULDN'T GIVE IT BUT SHE DID!!
      YASSSSSS.


      <br>
      Update 2: Srobona means Star in Bangla. I'll keep that in mind.
      Maybe I'll make a star themed gift for her on our anniversary.
      <br>
      Update 3: She's off to the airport. Life is good and life is <strong>empty</strong>. Save me :')
      Maybe one day I'll meet her again and we'll embrace and reminisce about
      these <em>Malaysian</em> nights we spent together.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        <strong>Hers.</strong></p>
