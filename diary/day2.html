        Dear Sappy,
      </span>
      <br>
      <p>Dear Sappy, Mr. S^#(%n came today. His wife and children
        seem like decent people. In fact, my mother seems to be
        wanting me and his eldest daughter to talk more to each other
        (She's 16). She told us that we'd have plenty to talk about
        over the dining table. It was kind of weird since mum does
        not like it when I talk to girls. Apparently, she wants me
        to get along with this one. Oh well...
        <br>
        Update: I tried coaxing her (the daughter) in with CSGO but
        failed pathetically in front of her. MIGHT I ADD THAT IT WAS
        AGAINST BOTS. BOTS! THERE GOES MY
        ELITE STATUS IN THE GAME. I don't understand why I was so
        nervous in front of her. Anyways, we played Uno afterwards
        in Zahra's room so it's all cool.
        I think. God I hope she doesn't think I'm just a loser...

        <br>
        Sincerely,
        The loser.</p>
