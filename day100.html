        Dear Sappy,

      Hey sayang. Are you enjoying the website so far?
      <br>
      I’m glad.
      <br>
      I made this for you. So that you’ll never forget how incredible our journey has been.
      <br>
      I purposely left out some major details inside the diary because I want it to be only
      for our minds and no one else’s but the diary above pretty much sums up how
      I felt in those Malaysian nights.
      <br>
      Sure our journey has been rough. It has been plagued by difficult fights and
      tough decisions we both had to make to keep our relationship together. But every
      time I think about you and the things you do, I know that it’s worth the fight.
      And every time we talk and laugh and fool around together, the world doesn’t seem
      as bad as I grew up believing it were.
      <br>
      On the bright side, statistically speaking, our most difficult stage in the relationship
      is over.

      You changed me to become a better person (you know the details).
      <br>
      Thank you.
      <br>
      Let’s keep on fighting this distance for future laughs and nights together.
      <br>
      Just like that Malaysian night.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        <strong>Your Jaan.</strong></p>
