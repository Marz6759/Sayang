        Dear Sappy,
      </span>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align:left;

      I woke up this morning, and was playing with my new phone when
      I realised I had a picture of her in it. From last night's dinner.
      Looking closely, she kinda resembles <em>Zendaya</em>. Meh, not my type.
      No. Wait. <strong>DAMN</strong>. Her hair does suit her! I think I want my future daughter
      to have cute flowy curly hair too! Is this some sort of thing I secretly
      dug but never admitted to?!
      <br>
      Update: Apparently she's <strong>definitely</strong> my type :') Spending the whole day
      in the airport made me realise she actually pretty darn beautiful. Good
      to know! Atleast now I know what I want in a girl. Uni should have someone
      like her right? Right??

      Update 2: WE'RE IN LANGKAWIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br>
      Also, I just noticed that her smile is exactly like mine. It's so weirddd AND SO
      CUTEEEEEEEE. How did I notice you ask? It's definitely not because I have a
      shit ton of pictures of her in my phone... Is that bad? It's not bad right? RIGHT?
      <br>
      Update 3: Keeping pictures of a 16 year old girl in your phone is definitely a
      bad sign! Friends are all cringing EVEN THOUGH SHE GAVE ME PERMISSION!
      <br>
      <br>
      Update 4: I just stuffed my face in her hair in the car. She probably thinks I am a weirdo...
      Do I have a crush? Maybe I do have a tiny crush. Eh, it'll pass.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        <strong>The Sad boi.</strong></p>
