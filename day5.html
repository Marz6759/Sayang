        Dear Sappy,
      </span>
      <br>

      So my dad likes her too. NO NOT IN THAT WAY! In the 'I think she's
      cool' kinda way. So both of my parents like her, damn she's one magnet huh.
      We're going back home today.
      It's sad that everything ended so fast. Oh well, at least we had fun.
      <br>
      Update: This guy we helped asked Srobona if I was her husband. She
      answered with a disgusted "NO". Help. My fragile heart has an ouchie.
      <br>
      Update 2: I have decided that my crush is meaningless. I do not feel
      for her because she definitely won't like me.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,
        <br>
        <strong>The Sad boi.</strong></p>
